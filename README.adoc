= `owned_ptr` - the missing C++ smart pointer?

== Why

C++ has two smart pointer classes, `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr`,
both of which are great.

`shared_ptr` allows shared ownership,
and uses internal reference counting to destroy the object only when all "handle" objects that refer to it are destroyed.
It also has some support for multiple threads through atomic reference counting.
This gives it some runtime overhead.
Furthermore, each handle object is the size of two pointers and the internal control block also has two pointers' worth of overhead.

`unique_ptr` is for exclusive ownership.
It has no run time overhead and (mostly) no memory overhead,
and it has great ownership semantics because the code makes it very obvious who owns the object and when it will be destroyed.

Some programmers prefer `shared_ptr` for everything,
while others frown upon that and advocate that one should always use `unique_ptr` where possible,
because of the extra overhead of Â´shared_ptr` and the superior semantics of `unique_ptr`.

Both of these are important points, and I tend to agree.

However, there are two problems with `unique_ptr` that make this a little more complicated.

First, `unique_ptr` is not "rule of zero" friendly.
The destructor of the type contained by the `unique_ptr` must be known when the destructor of the `unique_ptr` is invoked.
If you have a class "A" with a `unique_ptr<B>` member and no user defined destructor,
then the compiler will generate a default destructor for you.
This will happen in the header containing "A",
which means that this header must include the header for "B".

If you try to forward declare "B" then compilation will fail.
You can fix this by declaring a destructor for "A" in the header for "A" and implementing it in the source file,
but that violates "rule of zero" and you will then need to declare/define all the other four special member functions as well.

That is a lot of boilerplate code just for wanting to use `unique_ptr`.
Interestingly, `shared_ptr` does not have this problem.

You can avoid this by using a custom deleter,
but it is a little more complicated (and the handle object size will increase by the of one pointer).
This is kind of what `shared_ptr` does behind the scenes.

The second, more serious issue is memory safety.

Remember how `shared_ptr` ensured that the object was not destroyed until every reference to it was gone.
`unique_ptr` has no such features,
and any dependencies to the object from other users will use a simple pointer or reference.
This leaves the door wide open for use-after-free errors, where the object is destroyed while such pointers or references still exist elsewhere in your object graph.
This happens more often than one would think,
and use-after-free is a big source of security vulnerabilities.

All this makes `shared_ptr` seem more attractive than first thought, but when you think about it what it actually shows is that there is a need for third kind of smart pointer that sits between the two:
One that has better performance than `shared_ptr`, semantics that are as good as `unique_ptr`, but the memory safety and "rule-of-zero" properties of `shared_ptr`.

This is a library for such a smart pointer.

== The class

This library defines a smart pointer named `owned_ptr`.
This is a handle object (one pointer in size) that points to a block on the heap containing the owned object, a reference count and a deleter function (to make the class "rule-of-zero" friendly).

From this you can create `dep_ptr` instances,
which are the handle objects used for non-owning users of the object (dependencies).
There is also a `dep_ptr_const` which is created if the `owned_ptr` is const.

The destructor of the owned object is destroyed when the `owned_ptr` handle object is destroyed,
but the block (which also contains the reference count) is not deleted until the last `dep_ptr(_const)` is also destroyed.
Any attempt to access the object using a dependency handle object after the `owned_ptr` was destroyed is trapped,
which make uses of these classes safe against "use-after-free".

The size of the handle objects is a single pointer,
so this is more memory efficient than `shared_ptr`.
It is also much faster,
as it does not use atomics for reference counting.

It has much better memory safety than `unique_ptr`, and it allows "rule-of-zero" with forward declared classes.
